Solution Overview
This solution follows the Onion Architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The architecture is divided into the following layers:

Core Layer: Contains domain entities, interfaces, and business logic.

Application Layer: Implements use cases, services, and DTOs.

Infrastructure Layer: Handles data access, repositories, and external services.

Presentation Layer: Provides the user interface (WebAPI and WebUI).

Dependency Injection Layer: Centralizes dependency registration.

Tests Layer: Contains unit and integration tests.

Project Structure
The solution is organized into the following projects:

Core Layer
Core.Domain

Entities: Contains domain models (e.g., Product, Customer).

Interfaces: Defines abstractions for repositories and services.

Core.Application

DTOs: Data Transfer Objects for transferring data between layers.

Services: Implements application services and use cases.

Infrastructure Layer
Infrastructure.Persistence: Handles database access and Entity Framework configurations.

Infrastructure.Repository: Implements repository patterns for data access.

Presentation Layer
WebAPI: Provides RESTful API endpoints.

WebUI: Contains the user interface (e.g., MVC, Razor Pages).

Dependency Injection Layer
DependencyInjection: Centralizes dependency registration for the application.

Tests Layer
UnitTests: Contains unit tests for the application.

IntegrationTests: Contains integration tests for the application.

Technologies Used
.NET 6: The framework used for building the application.

Entity Framework Core: For database access and ORM.

ASP.NET Core: For building the WebAPI and WebUI.

xUnit: For unit and integration testing.

Dependency Injection: Built-in .NET Core DI container.

GitHub Actions: For CI/CD pipeline.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
.NET 6 SDK

Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code

SQL Server or SQLite for database.

Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OnionArchitectureDemo.git
cd OnionArchitectureDemo
Restore Dependencies:

bash
Copy
dotnet restore
Configure Database:

Update the connection string in appsettings.json (WebAPI project).

Run migrations to create the database:

bash
Copy
dotnet ef database update --project Infrastructure/Persistence
Run the Application:

Start the WebAPI project:

bash
Copy
dotnet run --project Presentation/WebAPI
Start the WebUI project (if applicable):

bash
Copy
dotnet run --project Presentation/WebUI
Running the Application
WebAPI:

Navigate to https://localhost:5001/swagger to access the Swagger UI for API documentation.

Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

WebUI:

Navigate to https://localhost:5002 to access the web interface.

Testing
Unit Tests
Run unit tests using the following command:

bash
Copy
dotnet test Tests/UnitTests
Integration Tests
Run integration tests using the following command:

bash
Copy
dotnet test Tests/IntegrationTests
